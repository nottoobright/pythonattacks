# slowloris.py - Simple slowloris in Python

## What is Slowloris?
Slowloris is basically an HTTP Denial of Service attack that affects threaded servers. It works like this:

1. We start making lots of HTTP requests.
2. We send headers periodically (every ~1 seconds) to keep the connections open.
3. We never close the connection unless the server does so. If the server closes a connection, we create a new one keep doing the same thing.

This exhausts the servers thread pool and the server can't reply to other people.

## How to run?
 *cd slowloris
 *python3 slowloris.py

##Counter to this attack for Apache Servers
* sudo apt-get -y install libapache2-mod-qos.
